# homelab-documentations
Overview

This is a documentation of my homelab architecture, purpose-built for learning, service hosting, and as a demonstration of my skills in infrastructure management, automation, and system administration. The setup uses Proxmox VE as the base hypervisor across three nodes, with ZFS, NFS, and high availability (HA) configurations to provide performance, redundancy, and scalability.
